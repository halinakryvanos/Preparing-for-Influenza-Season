# Preparing-for-Influenza-Season 
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

### Developed skills: 

- Analysis of medical data to determine the trends in virus contamination   
- Excel  
- Forecasting of manpower  
- Data treatment and Integration (Data cleaning, Data integration, Data transformation)  
- Statistical hypothesis testing 
- Visual analysis  
- Forecasting of manpower   
- Storytelling in Tableau  
- Presenting results to an audience (Refer to Video Presentation on **[YouTube](https://youtu.be/bTC6IxPkEjA)**).

### Requirements:

- Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.  
- Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.  
- Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?  
- Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.  
- Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.  

### Analysis Criteria:  
- Explain what cleaning you conduct on the data.  
- Select and integrate at least two relevant data sets from different sources.  
- Identify or create a hypothesis that you then test with the data.  
- Look at the relationship between variables with at least one correlation found.  
- Include spatial and temporal visualizations in your final deliverable.  
- Include your conclusions, recommendations, and proposed next steps in your final
presentation.  
- Consider the audience when determining which analysis components to include in
your final presentation  

### Recognize limitations   
**Influenza deaths by geography, time and age**  
- "Suppressed" data - mean values have been imputed that may affect this result. Most of the “supressed” values were reported for children under five years of age. However, children under five years of age are considereda vulnerable population and should be included in the report. because some states have a large population of the older generation. 
- Vulnerable population isare not limited to the elderly, pregnant women, children under 59 months of age, or people with chronic illnesses.  
- Only one primary cause of death is listed on the death certificate. Indicators are marked as "unreliable" when the number of deaths is less than 20. 

**2010 census data**  
Data was collected manually through interviews and surveys. In particular, the 2010 US Census was conducted by self-reporting citizens by mail, and the enumerators served to selectively check randomly selected areas and settlements. As part of efforts to improve counting accuracy, 635,000 temporary counters were hired.  

**Influenza Lab Datasets and Patient Visits**
This is a survey data - it is not complete and some participants may not have answered truthfully. It does not include data from 2016.  

**Children's flu shots**  
The data was collected through a survey and interviewers may not remember the exact dates. Data provided for 1 year 2017. At the time of analysis, this is not enough.  

### What was done in Excel  

- Analyzed of medical data and determined the trends in virus contamination.   
- Forecasted need for manpower.  
- Cleaned the data, performed consistency checks, data integration and hypothesis testing in MS Excel Hypothesis testing.   
- The final results examined trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.  

### Created presentation of the analysis results in Tableau

### Created video presentation of the analysis results on **[YouTube](https://youtu.be/bTC6IxPkEjA).**

### Recommendations
- Send additional personnel to New York and Pennsylvania from September until February.  
- Send additional personnel to California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan from November until March.  
- To determine the number of additional personnel sent, be guided by the number of vulnerable population in the state.  

### Retrospective  
The metric I would use to gauge the effectiveness of staffing changes would be the number of flu deaths in the next flu season. If there is an overall reduction in mortality, especially among vulnerable groups, in the states that have received the most additional medical personnel, then the plan can be considered a success. Further analysis may confirm or refute this assumption.  
 
I would also like to reconsider the vulnerability of the population under 65, since the correlation coefficient between the number of deaths and the population increases with age after 45 years.
