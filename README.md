The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

### Developed skills:  
- Analysis of medical data to determine the trends in virus contamination   
- Forecasting of manpower  
- Data treatment and Integration  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Tableau
- Refer to Video Presentation on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bTC6IxPkEjA).

### Requirements:

- Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.

- Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?  
- Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.  
- Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.  

### Analysis Criteria:  
- Explain what cleaning you conduct on the data.  
- Select and integrate at least two relevant data sets from different sources.  
- Identify or create a hypothesis that you then test with the data.  
- Look at the relationship between variables with at least one correlation found.  
- Include spatial and temporal visualizations in your final deliverable.  
- Include your conclusions, recommendations, and proposed next steps in your final
presentation.  
- Consider the audience when determining which analysis components to include in
your final presentation.
